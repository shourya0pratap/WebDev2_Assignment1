# Smart Event Dashboard

# Project Overview
The Smart Event Dashboard is a dynamic, single-page web application built to manage event cards through real-world DOM manipulation. This project was developed as part of the Web Dev II (Advanced JS & React) course to demonstrate mastery of vanilla JavaScript operations, event handling, and debugging.
